Bookmarks are matched with the MD5 hash of each book so they are valid even if you rename or move your books.

Default cache location is /tmp/ppub-cache/, you can change it by editing the configuration file (~/.ppub). If you do, keep the trailing '/' in the path.

In case you have a book that is not working, please extract your epub file like a zip and send me any .opf and .ncx files it has inside. I will do my best to fix the problem then :).
